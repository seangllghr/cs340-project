The specification for this first milestone called for an implementation of the
data access layer for a RESTful application, implementing the four basic CRUD
operations associated with database access. Implementation is in Javascript, to
better leverage the familiarity of front-end and full-stack developers with the
language, and is written to take advantage of the MongoDB Native Javascript
driver's asynchronous nature. For simplicity---and because this is a relatively
constrained use case---the entire data access layer is implemented in a single
Javascript source file, `dataAccess.js`. This file is included with the
submission, and is listed in its entirety in this document. In the interest of
keeping this submission as concise as possible, only `dataAccess.js` is included
in the submission; unit tests, as well as the `mile1.js` test script that
produced the output in Figures \ref{fig:exec1}--\ref{fig:exec6}, are available
from the project's [Github
repository](https://github.com/seangllghr/cs340-project).
